# SPS: Steam Profile Shortcut
Steam Profile Shortcut is a simple, command-line tool that allows you to enter a persons steam ID which will then be opened in the steam client.

This app is written in 100% Batch, meaning it is for **Windows Only**! Any other OS will *not* work. Though, more OS support will probably come in the future though.

## How to Use
Step I: Open/run "sps.bat"
Step II: From there, enter your desired steam ID - NOTE: This only accepts numeric IDs and not custom IDs.
Step III: Press Enter, and it should open the profile in the Steam Client.
